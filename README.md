I take my C# Telegram client [TLSharp](https://github.com/sochix/TLSharp) and made user friendly UI for it. Yes I do it for you, my lovely users, that have many difficulties with console and writing code.

In this time I don't want to open source it, you should use it AS-IS.

All of your data stored localy, app send data ONLY to Telegram servers.

New features will be available on-demand.

### Comments
Be sure `session.dat` is available for READ/WRITE.
