# Instagram bot <a href="https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-bot-cs/releases">v1.2.4</a>

Hi guys! This is my version of Instagram bot with UI, written on C#. Works without the new Instagram [api][2] (the new review process).

I take my python version [Instagram-API-python][1] and make user friendly UI for it. Yes I do it for you, my lovely users, that have many difficulties with console and writing code.

In this time I don't want to open source, any you should use it AS-IS.

All of your data storage local (encrypted), and send ONLY to Instagram by https.

This project will develop, provided YOUR interest in it.
